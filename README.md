# E-commerce Sales Data Visualization with Tableau

This project uses Tableau to analyze and visualize the sales data of an e-commerce company, incorporating information from demographic, product, and transaction datasets.

## Project Description

The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the sales performance of the e-commerce company by leveraging Tableau for data visualization. The project focuses on three key aspects:

1. **Demographic Overview Dashboard:** Explore the impact of customer demographics on buying behaviors. Visualize correlations between demographic factors and purchase patterns to identify potential target segments.

2. **Product Analysis Dashboard:** Dive into product-related insights, including top-selling products, popular brands, and department-wise sales comparisons. Understand customer preferences within product categories to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

3. **Time Analysis Dashboard:** Visualize sales trends over time to identify patterns, seasonality, and overall performance. Use time-based insights to make informed decisions about promotions, discounts, and inventory management.
